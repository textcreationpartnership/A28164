            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough this Survey of Purgatory addreſs it ſelf to all Roman Catholikes in general, yet is there not the perſon to whom it is more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly devoted, nor indeed any, from whom it may with more confidence look for ſhelter and entertainment then your ſelf.</p>
            <p>For were it a meer ſtranger to you, yet am I ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your noble hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and civility to all your gueſts, as not to deſpair of a
<pb facs="tcp:50147:3"/> friendly wellcome. But ſince it was ſo lucky as to receive its firſt birth, or at leaſt to begin to breath our Engliſh Aire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your roofe, it is certainly there it may beſt challenge countenance and protection, now it comes to appear abroad and expoſe it ſelf to publick view. And if I miſtake you not, you are neither ſo wedded to the pleaſures of this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life, as not to be more concerned for what paſſes in the other world, nor ſo taken up with Playes and Romances (the uſual employment of your ſex) but that you can lend an eye or an ear now and then (and with delight too) to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſcourſes, though run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a lower ſtrain, not ſo agreeable to the quaint Palats of our times. Howſoever I
<pb facs="tcp:50147:3"/> dare promiſe you here no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant entertainments; I am ſure at leaſt you are read a very pleaſing lecture in the laſt Survey. For while you ſee the way for you to ſcape Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory chalked out, you will clearly find your ſelf already in it, as practiſing moſt of the twelve means there preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. To ſay nothing of the reſt (in which no doubt you have a large ſhare) I cannot but take notice of two of the moſt important, I mean your ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>charity</hi> to the poor &amp; your <hi>patient ſuffering</hi> for a good cauſe. Your loyalty (and your noble Conſorts) to God and your King, even when you ſaw others to renounce both, was very remarkable, and I think I may ſafely ſay (with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Eſtate) you were
<pb facs="tcp:50147:4"/> as great ſufferers upon this ſcore, as the worſt of times could produce. And yet you were never ſo great looſers your ſelves, but you could ſtill have the heart to ſpare a very liberal proportion to relieve others. I could bring inſtances, and enlarge my ſelf upon each particular, did not your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty give me a ſilent check. I will only then conclude with leaving you this comfortable ſatisfaction to know you are in the ready way to redeem a good part of your Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in this life, if not all, as he moſt heartily wiſhes you may, who muſt ever ſubſcribe himſelf,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe drift of this Treatiſe is not to prove Purgatory but taking it for granted as a prime maxime of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſm, that God has a ſuffering Church in the other world, beſides that which triumphes in heaven and is mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here upon earth, the deſign is to ſet it forth in ſuch lively colours, as may not only expreſs its nature (as far as we are able to judge of it at ſo great a diſtance) but raiſe your thoughts, firſt to a compaſſionate care for the preſent, of procuring all poſſible relief for ſuch diſtreſſed ſouls, as are already faln under the laſh of thoſe mercileſs torments, and ſecondly to a provident prevention for the future, that the like miſchief may not involve your ſelves hereafter. Now this being the chief aime of theſe my labours, I am put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a kind of neceſſity of giving you the trouble of this Prefatory addreſs. For ſhould this Survay of Purgatory fall
<pb facs="tcp:50147:5"/> into any other hands but yours, it could look for no better entertainment, then to be laid aſide for waſt paper, ſuch as would be ſome ſtrange Map, or Survay of another world which had no other ſubſiſtance but in the brains of the Painter. For why ſhould the enemies of truth, whoſe belief reaches only to heaven and hell, amuſe themſelves with the conſideration of a third place, for which they can find no place in their Creed. And yet, though I preſume, this will be its common fate, when it meets with ſuch perſons, yet I am very confident the judicious Proteſtant, if he can but find in his heart to peruſe theſe Papers, (eſpecially the fifth Survay) will find more then enough to convince him of this middle ſtate of Souls, which we call Purgatory.</p>
            <p>Now to ſay the truth of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I know not well how to profeſs my ſelf the Author, nor yet the Tranſlator of it. Not Author, for I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the maine bulke and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I offer to be borrowed of the Reverend Father <hi>Steven Binet</hi> of the Society of Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:50147:5"/> Not a bare Tranſlatour, becauſe I am to do my ſelf ſo much right, as to tell you, that I have not tied my ſelf ſo wholly, to that worthy perſons method, or matter, as not to yeeld a little now and then to my own genius, but have ſo made uſe of his learned pen, as to diſpoſe, abridge or enlarge, where I took it to be more for your ſatisfaction, in this conjuncture of time and place wherein I was to puhliſh it.</p>
            <p>As for the language, I have taken care, neither to have it ſo bald, as not to ſute a little with this eloquent age we live in, nor yet ſo flouriſhing and luxuriant, as to dry up the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of devotion, which I ſeek to open. And if all my endeavours prove but ſo lucky, as to occaſion the releaſing of any one ſoul, out of Purgatory, or the conveying of any other into heaven, without paſſing that way, I have my end, which is only the greater glory of God, and the good of ſouls There was a Roman Emperour, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dine, but he would be feeding his eyes, and his thoughts with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the torments of hell, and the
<pb facs="tcp:50147:6"/> pleaſures of the <hi>Elizian</hi> fields, which he had cauſed to be curiouſly painted, and expoſed, for that purpoſe, in his dining room I do not preſs you to uſe any ſuch devotion or pictures, I only offer you this Survay of Purgatory, which I beſeech you to look often upon, and withall to have an eye ſtill upon heaven, and the beſt meant how to ſend ſouls thither, and to follow them your ſelves, without ſtepping a ſide into Purgatory, for believe it, if you come once there, you will find it a very reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uncomfortable lodging which I pray God you may all timely prevent, and I earneſtly beg your good prayers that the like mercy may not be deuied.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50147:10"/> ſaw ſo cruelly miſuſed, was the very man they ſpake of. And this they followed with ſhowers of teares, preaching Chriſts Paſſion, more with their eyes then their tongues; and figuring their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with ſighs and ſobs, and a mournfull voice, in liew of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tropes, and Metaphors.

The heart has this property to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the language of hearts, let the expreſſions of the tongue be never ſo imperfect; and the eyes are of that ſympatheticall nature, that when eyes ſpeak to them, in floods of teares, in liew of full periods, they inſtantly melt alſo into teares; and ſo mingle their griefs, with a ſtrange

The <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers laboured to <note place="margin">Real fire in Purgatory.</note> undeceive them in this point of folly, and ſore gravelled them, with that text of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>He ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire,</hi> which cannot be meant of hell fire, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, becauſe there is no <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> or redemption to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but well of the fire of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50147:12"/> Purgatory, which is deſigned only, for the purifying of <hi>ſaved</hi> ſoules. And though they thought fit afterwards to wave that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie for peace ſake, and not to preſs on to a definition; yet is it a doctrine very generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and taught by the holy Fathers, and Doctours of the Catholick Church, and very conſonant to the dictates of the holy Ghoſt, in divine Scriptures, that there is a reall and corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fire in Purgatory, and that the ſoules which depart this life, without firſt cancelling their many failings and imperfections, by ſatisfactory workes, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily plunged into mercileſs flames, which by little and little, eate away all that droſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, which till expiated, obſtructs their entrance into heaven. Nor is it poſſible to my thinking to rayſe any argument of ſubſtance, to diſcredite theſe purging flames, which will not alſo be levelled at the extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50147:13"/> caſe, when the queſtion is ſtarted, about Purgatory fire, which I ſhall ever reckon, in the claſſe of thoſe truths, which cannot be contradicted, without manifeſt temerity, as being the doctrine generally preached and taught all over Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p>You muſt then conceive Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory <note place="margin">Purgatory deſcribed.</note> to be a vaſt, darkſome, and hideous Chaos, full of fire and flames, in which the ſoules are kept cloſe priſoners, untill they have fully ſatisfied for all their miſdemeanours, according to the eſtimate of divine juſtice. For God has made choice of this Element of fire, wherewith to puniſh ſoules, becauſe it is the moſt active, piercing, ſenſible, and inſupportable of all others. But that which quickens it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and gives it more life is this; that it acts as the inſtrument of Gods juſtice, who by his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power, elevates and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces its activity as he pleaſes; and ſo makes it capable to act
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50147:13"/> upon pure ſpirits. Do not then look only upon this fire, though in good earneſt it be dreadfull enough of it ſelf, but conſider the arme that is reached out, and the hand that ſtrikes, and the rigour of Gods infinite juſtice, who through this element of fire, vents his wrath, and powers out whole tempeſts of his moſt ſevere, and yet moſt juſt vengeance: So that the fire workes as much miſchief (as I may ſay) to the ſoules, as God commands, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as much as is due, and as much is due, as the ſentence bears; a ſentence irrevocably pronounced at the high Tribunal of the ſevere and rigorous juſtice, of an angry God, and whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſo prevalent, that the holy Scripture ſtiles it, a day of fury: Now you will eaſily believe, that <note place="margin">Job, 20. 28. Eſa. 13. 13. Thr. 1. 12.</note> this fire is a moſt horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in its own nature, but you may doe well, to reflect alſo on that which <hi>I</hi> have now ſuggeſted, that the fury of Almighty God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50147:14"/> is as it were the fire of this fire, and the heat of its heat; and that he ſerves himſelf of it as he pleaſes, by doubling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50147:15"/> hell. Alas! how will it fare with them when they ſhall ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tied to unmercifull fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, or imbodied as it were with flames of fire, ſurrounded with frightful darkneſs, broyled and conſumed without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perhaps condemned to the ſame fire, with which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels are unſpeakably tormented? When <hi>Saul</hi> found himſelf beſet on all ſides, and in the midſt of his enemies, and ſaw, that he muſt either dye inſtantly, or fall into the hands of that baſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed crue.

O God! what a confuſion, what a ſenſible heart-breaking will it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50147:15"/> be to theſe noble and generous ſoules, deſigned to eternall glory in the Kingdom of Heaven, when they ſhall ſee themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the ſame puniſhment, and devoured by the ſame impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable flames with thoſe of the damned; and lodged in the very ſuburbs of hell. A Prince had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die a thouſand deaths, then be condemned to live amongſt baſe ſlaves in a gally, or be hang'd amongſt fellons, for it is not the death ſo much, as the diſhonour, that makes them to die indeed. And can you doubt whether the ſoules of the juſt have the ſame feelings, when they ſee themſelves involved in the ſame misfortune, in the ſame place, and in the ſame flames of fire, with which the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed rable of damned ſpirits is eternally tormented? ah! they take it for ſo high a diſhonour, that it may with reaſon be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether this unhappy place and condition grieves them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50147:16"/> not more then the fire it ſelf. <note place="margin">Plut.

What a tearing grief muſt it be to thoſe vertuous ſoules, when they ſhall ſee themſelves border upon the very confines of hell; and in that accurſed fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and more then this, to be ſhut up cloſe priſoners in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate gulfe; and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſuffer the ſame fire as the damned, though their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be neither ſo terrible, nor ſo laſting?</p>
                  <p>Good God! how the great Saints and Doctours aſtoniſh me, when they treate of this fire, and of the paine of ſence as they tall it. For they peremptorily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50147:16"/> pronounce, that the fire that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thoſe both happy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Soules ſurpaſſes all the torments, which are to be found in this miſerable life of man, or are poſſible to be invented, for ſo far they go. Out of which aſſertion it cleerly follows, that the furious fits of the ſtone, feavour or raging gout, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting chollick, with all the horrible convulſions of the worſt of diſeaſes nay though you joyn racks, grid-Irons, boyling oyles, wild beaſts, and a hundred hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes drawing ſeveral waies, and tearing one limb from another, with all the other helliſh devices of the moſt barbarous and cruell Tyrants, all this does not reach to the leaſt part of the mildeſt pains in Purgatory. For thus they diſcourſe: the fire, and the pains of the other world are of another nature from thoſe of this life, becauſe God elevates them above their nature to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his ſeverity. Now, ſay
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50147:17"/> they, things of an inferior degree can never reach to the power of ſuch things as are of a higher ranke; for example, the ayre let it be never ſo inflamed, unleſs it be converted into fire, can never be ſo hot as fire. Beſides God bridles his rigour, in this world, but in the next he lets the reines looſe, and puniſhes almoſt equally to the deſert. And ſince thoſe ſoules have preferred creatures before their Creatour, he ſeems to be put upon a neceſſity of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them beyond the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrength of creatures, and hence it is, that the fire of Purgatory burnes more, torments and afflicts more, then all the creatures of this life are able to doe.

Have patience to heare them yet once more; ſinne, ſay they, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all creatures in malice, and therefore let it be never ſo little, it muſt deſerve a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exceeding all the pain that can proceed from creatures. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, creatures here below do nothing above their natural reach and capacity, they act only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſphere of their limited forces, whereas the fire that is deſigned to purify guilty ſoules, derives its vigour and force from God, Who being Almighty, and beſides provoked to diſpleaſure, makes it ſo active and ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that there is nothing can be compared with it. And they adde unto all this a world of viſions, and revelations, which ſeem to countenance the rigour of their poſition. What then will become

                  <p>But for thy comfort, there are Doctours in the Catholick church, that cannot away with ſo much ſeverity, and namely St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who is very peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <note place="margin">S. <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. in</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> 20.</note> in denying it. For what way is there (ſaies this holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) to verify ſo great a paradox, without wounding reaſon, and deſtroying the infinite mercy of the living God. I am eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there are torments in Purgatory far exceeding any in this mortall life, this is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and it is but reaſonable it ſhould be ſo, but that the leaſt there, ſhould be more terrible then the moſt terrible in the world, cannot enter into my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. May it not often fall out, that a man comes to dye, in a moſt eminent ſtate of perfection, ſave only, that in his laſt agony, out
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50147:18"/> of mere frailty, he commits a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſin, or carries along with him ſome relique of his former fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which might have been eaſily blotted out with a Pater noſter, or waſh'd away with a little holy water: for I ſuppoſe, it is ſome very ſmall matter, now, what likelihood is there, I will not ſay, that the infinite mercy of God, but that the very rigour of his juſtice, though you conceive it to be never ſo ſevere, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ſo horrible a puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this holy ſoul, as not to be equalled by the greateſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this life, and all this for ſome petty fault, ſcarſe worth the ſpeaking of? How! would you have God for a kind of trifle, to puniſh a ſoule full of grace and vertue, and ſo ſeverely to puniſh her, as to exceed all the racks, cauldrons, furnaces, and other helliſh inventions, which are ſcarce inflicted upon the moſt execrable criminals in the world? What do you make God to be! is he not a God of mercy in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50147:19"/> other world as well as in this? He, ſays <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that is ſo ſweet <note place="margin">Tertul. Apol.</note> and ſo good, that he darts the rayes of his mercies into the darkeſt abyſs of hell, ſhall he be ſo extreamly rigorous in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory which is ſo full of Saints? That which a ſigh would have blown away here, or a teare have drowned, it was ſo ſmal a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will you have God to power out his whole wrath for it, and to puniſh it with ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſufferings, as cannot be paralleld by all the torments in this world? Have a care leaſt by making God too ſevere, you ſay not that which claſhes with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy. That nothing ſhould remain unpuniſhed, is no more then fitting, but that for a mere Peccadilio, or for ſome ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of a little penance, God ſhould employ ſuch tortures, is a moſt incredible paradox, and S. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> will not believe it, and are we not beholding to him for it? He confeſſes that the fire,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50147:19"/> the worme, and all the purging paine is of its nature far greater then the pains of this world, but that the leaſt there ſhould ſurpaſs the greateſt here, he flatly denies; and I cannot think thou wilt need much entreaty to ſide with him.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50147:20"/> which knawes them yet more to the quick, then thoſe murthering flames, which make but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſault. It is this worme alas! it is this worme, that plays the tyrant over thoſe captive ſoules. The worme of hell ſhall <hi>never dye,</hi>

I know there are thoſe among the learned, that believe, God has in ſtore certain ravenous and devouring wormes, that ſhall inceſſantly prey upon the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes of the damned ſoules, and cauſe an endleſs martyrdome, by conſuming them without ever yet conſuming them. But as for Purgatory, where there are only naked ſoules, ſtript of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there are no corporeal wormes, but the worme, that knaws them, is a metaphorical worme, or a ſharpe and ſenſible grief, and deep reſentment, which utterly undoes thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſoules, by piercing and

They ſeem as it were to be drawn in pieces by Wilde-horſes. Love draws, but pain withdraws, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition ſpurs them on, but their misfortune pulls them back; Hope gives them wings, but Juſtice clips them off, and through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe contrary Motions, theſe unfortunate Souls are in a moſt lamentable condition, and as the Holy Scripture expreſſes it, are knawn and torn in pieces, with Hungry, Devouring and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Worms.

A moment loſt of thoſe inebriating joyes, ſeems to her now worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with an eternity of pains. Then reflecting with her ſelf, that ſhe was created only for God, and can not be truly ſatisfied, but by enjoying God, and that out of him all this goodly machine of the world, is no better then a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Hell, and an abiſſe of evills, alas! what Worms? what Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes, and what nipping Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, are ſuch pinching thoughts

There was a King in an humour gave away his Crown and his whole Eſtate, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent refreſhment of a cup of cold water, but returning a little to himſelf, and ſoberly reflecting what he had done, had like to have run ſtark mad, to ſee the ſtrange irreparable folly he had committed.

And that poore youth, from whom they had ſtolne his gods, although they were meere Idols, yet did he take on moſt bitterly, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo diſconſolate, there was no chiding him out of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. What! ſaid he have you rob'd me of my gods, and do you now queſtion me, why I lament, as if he had not cauſe enough to grieve, who has loſt his gods? And you may obſerve, it was not his fault that they were loſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they were but gods of wood and ſtone, ſuch as a skilfull Artiſt would have made farr better. The caſe here is different, for the Souls clearly ſee, they have loſt God, through their own careleſneſs, and loſt him for ten, twenty or perhaps thirty years, and this puts them out of the reach of all comfort. Tis true, here below we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to taſte the bitterneſſe of this wormwood, but thoſe pure Souls who are in the grace of God, and full of light, and well grounded

                  <p>But you will ſay, it is but for a ſhort time, that they are to be kept out of paradiſe.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50147:27"/> a ſignal teſtimony of the dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their Souls. In the mean time, this their honeſty coſts them dear, and theſe acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and contrition are extream painful. And ſince the ſting of honour wounds deeper, pains ſorer and goes more to the quick, then pain it ſelf, hence it follows, that theſe holy Souls, whether for Love, or for juſtice ſake, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a moſt cruel rack, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an object of great commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration, and it cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, how beholding they take themſelves to thoſe, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to comfort them, and are mindful of their calamity. Now the reaſon, why divines believe, that the moſt perfect Soules are the moſt afflicted, with theſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary kind of puniſhments, as I may tearm them, is, becauſe they all actuate according to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Sphere and extent of their vertue, ſo that a Soul that has a greater proportion of Love, acts with more vigour, and plunges
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50147:27"/> her ſelf deeper in the profound abiſſe of Love, and in the Gall and bitterneſs of contriſion, and as this proceeds out of meer love, notwithſtanding their ſo ſenſible misfortune, they would not looſe an ounce of it, ſo tender is their love to God, and ſo great the horrour they have of all that is diſpleaſing in his ſight.

                  <p>Now I muſt tell you plainly, all <note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pain of loſs.</note> that I have yet ſaid, is in a manner nothing to what I am going to ſay. The Saints and Doctors of Gods Church, as I have already inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unanimouſly agree, that the moſt grievous pain in Purgatory, is to be deprived for a time of the beatifical viſion, and to be laid aſide, and baniſht as unworthy to contemplate the bright Sun of the divinity. This pain of loſs, as they call it, is the pain of pains, it is the deepeſt pit of Purgatory, and the very bellows that blowes the coales there. This evil of the privation of the ſight of God, is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50147:28"/> according to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> of its own <note place="margin">
                        <hi>St.</hi> Th. <hi>in</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> 21. <hi>a.</hi> 1.</note> nature far exceeding all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments of this world, and thus he proves it. Will you know the full latitude of grief, and take an exact ſurvey of all its dimenſions, reflect with your ſelf what the good is, it deprives us of, what the preſent evil we endure, what powerful inſtinct we have, to repoſſeſs that good which we have loſt, what obligation we have thereunto both by Grace and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and laſtly what a violent application and vigour of Spirit we feel in our Souls, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite of it. Now all this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, in the evil we now treat of. For it is Gods precious ſight which is loſt, who is the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all bliſs, it is the very dregs of bitterneſs, thoſe poore Souls drink down at large draughts, it is the only beautiful object, for which they were Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and Redeemed, with the moſt precious blood of Chriſt, for which they breathed out ſo many
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50147:28"/> ſighs in this mortal life, and which they do ſo paſſionately purſue, when once delivered out of their bodies, that there is nothing to be compared to that holy ardour. No, I do not think, that an arrow ſhot from a bow, or an Eagle upon the wing, or the winde, or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the Sun in his ful careere or flight it ſelfe flies away faſter, I cannot believe that fire mounts up, or a ſtone ſinks down to its center with more vehemency, nor that the Heavens can be ſwifter in their motions, then theſe vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Souls are in running, flying, and precipitating themſelves into God, when alas! they find their wings clipt, and their whole flight ſo unluckily ſtopt, that no tongue is able to expreſs the reſentment they feel at it.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50147:29"/> this life. I will not take upon me the boldneſs, to make my ſelfe judge and umpire between St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and Saint <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> that is to ſay; between an Angel and a Seraphin, an angelical doctor and a Seraphical Doctor; in a word, between two famous oracles of Divinity, two glorious Suns placed in the ſeveral Spheres of their religious orders. But what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy! whether of the two ſhal we believe? The one aſſures us, that the privation of the ſight of God, is a martyrdomes beyond all the Martyrdome, of this world, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tels us for a truth that it were certainly a moſt grievous torment but that it is ſomtimes ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and alleniated by other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that it equals not the ſevereſt rigour of the Torments of this world. What? is there no means to reconcile theſe two hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctors? May we not ſay, they have both reaſon on their ſides, they have both won, and both loſt the field, and whilſt the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50147:29"/> one looks as it were to the North, &amp; the other to the South, they both meet in the Meridian line of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and reſt ſecurely in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the ſame truth. St <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> would ſay, that if you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this privation, as it relates to God, the loſs is incomparable, and he ſpeaks the very truth; that the Soul has not a more violent inſtinct, then that which carries her to God, this is alſo an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth; that there cannot be a heavier loſs, then that of God, and is not this alſo clear? That unleſs this greife be otherwiſe moderated, it is the moſt intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of all others; this is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as the reſt: that you cannot deprive a Soul of a more lively object, and conſequently that there is not the thing in this world whoſe abſence is of its Nature ſo ſenſible, who can doubt of all this? certainly, if you ſtate the caſe thus, and go no further, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> has clearly got the victory. Now let us hear St. <hi>Bonaventure.</hi> Who tels us
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50147:30"/> that this evil of privation, being joyned with a moſt certaine hope of ſeeing God ere long, may be much leſſened, that even in this world, we want the ſight of God, and yet by reaſon of other diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are not ſo much concerned for it, that the holy Souls moſt contentedly ſubmit themſelves, to this piece of ſeverity, and the more willingly they do it, the leſs are they burthened with ſorrow: that many Saints out of pure cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and for the glory of God, have offered themſelves to be thus eternally deprived of the ſight of God, and have taken great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it, with a world of other reaſons, of which I ſhall treat in the next Survey, where I muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that in truth there is ſomthing in this pain of loſs, which ſurpaſſes all that can be imagined in this world, but that God is pleaſed in ſome caſes to mingle certaine Comfortable ſweets with it, which take off much of the bitterneſs which the Souls would otherwiſe find in it.</p>

For ſince private revelations, are not Articles of Faith, we muſt be very cautious, and proceed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50147:38"/> warily in this matter, eſpecially where we ſee ſuch kind of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeemingly to claſh one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another.

Wherefore in this place I mean not to ſpeak, but of the common and ordinary ſtile of Gods providence, laying aſide all particular viſions, and perſonal exemplar puniſhments, which God has reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Now there have been ſome ſo bold, as to maintain, that all the ſouls lye in Purgatory but a few hours, and are then quit and releaſed of their pains. Their <note place="margin">The Souls not ſo ſoon releaſed as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</note> grounds are, firſt, becauſe the pains may be ſo doubled, and ſcrued up to ſuch a height, as to equall any extenſion of pain what ſoever. Secondly, becauſe the ſouls there do exerciſe ſuch acts of love, and other ſublime ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, all which conſpire to purify
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50147:39"/> theſe poore creatures, ſo that the buſineſſe is ſoon diſpatched. Were this true, it were very good news, but the miſchief is, that moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines cenſure this aſſertion as too bold and temerarious, and in truth it has very little or no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, and were a way in effect to deſtroy Purgatory, ſince we may cut off half of thoſe few hours they ſpeak of, by redouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pains, and another half of theſe by redoubling them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſo go ſtill halving the time, by doubling the paines till we reduce them to a quarter of an houre, or half a quarter, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to an inſtant, or ſo little du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as to be ſcarce begun but ended. Which kind of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though it may have place in thoſe ſouls which depart imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the intention of the pain muſt ſupply for the extent of time, which will be then wanting, in regard that there is to be no more Purgatory, after that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50147:39"/> accompting day, yet to apply it commonly to other ſouls, where there is no need of ſuch ſubtilties, were to confound all things. It is the ordinary ſtrain of Gods Juſtice, to proceed by degrees, and therfore there muſt be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent time allotted for thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. And this is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral belief of the Church, that the ſouls are kept there for a time, ſome more, ſome leſſe, each one according to his deſert, and though happily ſome choyce ſouls, do but as it were kiſſe the gates of Purgatory, and rather feel the ſmoak then the fire, yet the greater part of them, lye there for ſome conſiderable time, to ſatisfy the ſweet rigour of divine juſtice. I am not ignorant, that ſome great Divines have believed, that if a ſoul ſtay there for a year or two it is all. For ſay they, how can you require more of them, then to be two years miſerably tormented in a burning furnace? That which here might have been
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50147:40"/> redeemed with a tear of true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or with a ſigh of ardent charity, can it not be purged with flames of fire, in two whole years in the other world? The moſt barbarous cruelty in this life, is ſcarce ever ſeen to reach beyond a few houres, and what ſhall we then ſay, of two years in Purgatory, which are as it were two ages, or two little eternities, (ſo great are the torments) ſhall it not be enough, to purifie the moſt unclean ſoul in the world, ſo ſhe be in the ſtate of Grace. But yet this opinion is not received in the Church, and it is a great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to attempt any thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common judgment of the Church; and her Learned Doctors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sotus</hi> held a ſingular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his own; that no ſoule <note place="margin">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50147:40"/> and is ſaid to diſpoſe all things ſweetly. And is not ten years of moſt bitter pains, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a grievous weight and an everflowing meaſure, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſo many prayers, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maſſes, ſo many tears, ſo many priviledged altars, and Plenary indulgences, ſo many almes, and other good deeds of the living, and then the moſt powerful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the whole court of Heaven, but eſpecially of our bleſſed Lady, and her beloved ſon, who is the Atturney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the whole Church, and who pleads for her with a moſt perſwaſive and divine Rhetorique. Yet for all this, I muſt tell you, many divines lay heavy cenſures upon this opinion, ſticking not to call it, not only temerarious, but alſo erroneous; and the common ſenſe of the church is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as appears by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial cuſtome, of perpetual foundations of ſet Maſſes, to be yearly ſaid, for ſuch particular
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50147:41"/> perſons, and to continue to the worlds end, all which would be needleſs, if almighty God put a period to their puniſhments, after ten years; for to what purpoſe are thoſe Maſſes after the ten years, are expired? And though the moſt learned of this age, will not take upon them to condemne this opinion of errour, yet they all accuſe it of much temerity, <note place="margin">No certain time beyond which a ſoule may not be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note> becauſe in truth this whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is very uncertain, as being a ſecret lockt up in the cabinet of God himſelf, and letters ſealed up, which our Saviour would not hitherto open to his Spouſe the church, ſo that whilſt it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the nature of a ſecret, we muſt not preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine any thing preciſely. Only this we know, that many ſoules, do but touch Purgatory as it were with their finger and away, others lie there whole houres, dayes, months, and years, and as we are not eaſily to credit thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which threaten the ſoules
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50147:41"/> in Purgatory, with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their torments untill the laſt day, ſo are we to believe, that God can well puniſh ſome of them, ſo long that the ſpace of ten years, in compariſon ſhould ſeem little or nothing to it. Hence it is a very laudable and pious cuſtome, to found Maſſes to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, becauſe alas! who knows whether he may not be, of the number of thoſe unfortunate ſouls, who are to be kept there ſo long. How few know truly the ſtate of their own ſoules, and the debts they are to pay to the ſeverity of our moſt juſt judge, who is indeed ful of clemency, but ſuch as is ever accompanied, with an impartial juſtice worthy of God. I may adde here, that the piety of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, looks not only upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing of their own ſoules out of torments, which they are aſſured will have an end ſooner or later, but they open their hearts and bowels of charity, and extend it to others, who from time to time
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50147:42"/> ſhall be in Purgatory, and very poſſibly, have no body to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them in their devotions. This certainly is a worke of charity, well becoming a good Catholick, and a well diſpoſed ſoule, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſo, as to co-operate even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death to the help, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of other ſoules, and to be ever and anon ſending ſome into Heaven, by antedating the time of their deliverance, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the number of the glorious Saints.

Do not good people generally ground themſelves upon this, when they offer up their prayers, give almes, procure Maſſes and Diriges, apply Indulgences, for the preſent relief of their deceaſed friends? Is not the whole practiſe of Chriſtians (for as much as concernes their piety to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full departed) built ſo wholly upon this, that (were it not true) we muſt conclude, that the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50147:43"/> whole Catholick church has been all along fooled, by her Paſtors and Doctors? Who has ever hitherto ſo much as fancied it in a dreame, that his ſuffrages for the dead, were to be of no greater advantage to them, then as far forth as they had power, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the time appointed for the day of judgement? which for my part I apprehend ſo coldly, that, did I not relie upon better mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, I ſhould ſoon lay a ſide all devotion for the ſoules departed.</p>

And ſo I take no notice, how it can ſtand with Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice, that, whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoules may leave this world, in the ſame condition, as to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, that is (in this Authors opinion) with the ſame bur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IT is pitty to ſee ſometimes how your greateſt divines are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, and loſt in their over ſubtile ſpeculations. As for the pain of loſs, which the ſoules en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure by being deprived of the ſight of God, they agree; that, it is daily much leſſened, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time draw nearer, in which they are to be made happy with the ſight of God, whom they love ſo ardently, it exceedingly rejoyces them, and certainly they cannot chuſe but much ſweeten, and conſequently leſſen their pains, by the frequent repetitions of that devout aſpiration, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Tereſia</hi> was wont to uſe, when ſhe heard the clock ſtrike. <hi>O lovely houre, how doſt thou rejoyce me, by bringing me the welcome newes, that I am now a whole houre nearer to the ſight of God.</hi> For a heart that loves, cannot but be overjoyed, to know, that, he approaches to the faire object of his love, though it be

But as for the paine of ſence, your Doctors are divided, ſome hold, that as for the continuance, that is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhortned every day, by the day that is paſt, which is evident, and in particular, that the prayers of the faithfull, obtain of God, an abridgement of the length of the time, which he taxed for their puniſhment, ſo that the more one prayes for the ſouls, the more is cut off, of the time of their ſuffering, which by that means becomes the more tolerable. But as for the ſharpeneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs of the paine, and the action or activity of the fire, as they ſpeak in ſchools, that is as grievous in the laſt moment, as at the firſt, and as painful in the end, as at the beginning of their Purgatory.

And why not? ſince Gods goodneſs is ſo great, ſuch is the deſire of the Church that begs it, the tears of the faithful pretend to no leſs, and we muſt not conſider the fire as an Element working naturally, and equally at all times, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an inſtrument of Gods juſtice, who gives it more or leſs force and power, to worke upon the ſoules, as he pleaſes. Why ſhould Almighty God, who is ſo loving a Father, refuſe to give this relief, at the earneſt ſuite of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in behalf of their Parents, Brothers, Siſters, and deareſt friends, I ſay at their inſtance, who are ſo ſenſible of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo much concerned for their eaſe and relief. I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace this opinion, as more worthy of the bowels of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50147:46"/> mercy, more ſympathizing with the heart of Chriſt Jeſus, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuiting with the prayers of the Church, and the ſighs of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And certainly none can better clear this difficulty, then the ſoules themſelves, who feel the pains we ſpeak of, and theſe have often by Gods permiſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to their friends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout perſons, and born witneſſe for this truth; that their pains were ſtill leſſened, as they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved new ſuccour, from the pious endeavours of their friends upon earth, untill they came at length to ceaſe and determine. And we muſt not here be too nice, and hard of belief, for, as it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of too much raſhneſſe and folly, to give credite to all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended viſions, of what nature ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo it argues too much brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and profaneſs, to believe none; eſpecially, when they are authorized by the Church, and by perſons of authority and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit beyond exception, that we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50147:47"/> muſt either believe them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing in this World.</p>

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this fancy may appear to have ſomthing of piety, yet has it little or nothing of ſolidity, and

                  <p>TO make this good, we muſt <note place="margin">A ſeparate ſoul acts without controule.</note> firſt ſuppoſe, that the actions of a ſoul diſengaged from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are quite of a different nature, from thoſe which ſhe exerciſes, while ſhe is chained to a lumpe of fleſh, drowned in blood and other humours, kept in thraldome by her tyrannical paſſions, and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh affections, overburthened with deadly frights, and fears, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a kind of ſlaviſh, and miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life. <hi>Tertullian</hi> came near the marke, when he compared a ſoul in this world, to a Coach-man, that is to guide four unruly Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, without Rains, a Souldier that has his Sword in his hand, but his Armes tied, a ſwift courſer, that would run, but is tethered, a bird
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50147:51"/> that would fly, but has his wings clammed up with Bird-lime. Now when the ſoul is once ſet free from this bondage, and lives at liberty, this Coach-man drives, this Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſtrikes, this Courſer runs, this Bird flies, and this Soul does what ſhe pleaſes without controule. Beſides, that which makes the actions of a Soul in this life, to be ſo weak and unperfect, is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary dependance, which ſhe has of the body, into which ſhe is ſo ingrafted, that ſhe ſeems, to be but one, and the ſelfe ſame thing with it. If the body be oppreſſed with pain, the ſoul is ſo deeply plunged in it, ſhe can think of nothing elſe; you muſt work a miracle, to make her have ſo much as a good thought, or g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When almighty God was pleaſed once, to reveal unto St. <hi>Francis,</hi> his eternal predeſtination, and to ſeal him, as it were, a deed of gift of Paradiſe, this Seraphin incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, was ſo tranſported, with an

Now, if we <note place="margin">Suar. d. 47. <hi>S.</hi> 3.</note> credit, the holy doctours of the Church, and beſt divines of the Chriſtian world, the Souls in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, are moſt certaine of their ſalvation: For no ſooner is the Soul departed this life, but ſhe is brought to a particular judgment where ſhe receives an award of her eternal ſtate of glory, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,

They ſay further, that in the ſame moment, that a Soul ſees her ſelfe condemned to Purgatory, ſhe ſees alſo, the preciſe time, preſcribed her, to continue there, according to the ordinary ſtrain of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But whether ſhe know alſo by divine revelation, who will pray for her, and what aſſiſtance in particular they will give her, or how much will be cut of, of the time determined for her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a nicer queſtion, which I purpoſely leave untouched for others to excerciſe their wits in, as they pleaſe, and make haſt to take up the thred of my diſcourſe, I was letting fall, in which I am to lay before your eyes, the ineffable joyes of the ſoules in purgatory, when they ſeriouſly reflect, upon

When <hi>Jacob</hi> knew for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that he was to have the fair <hi>Rachel,</hi> he was content to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed firſt to <hi>Lia,</hi> though ſhe were blear-eyed, and ill favoured, and beſides, a world of heats and colds, frights and fears, and fourteen years toyleſome ſervice, ſeemd ſcarſe an hour to him, ſo much was his heart inchanted, with a holy love, of his dearly beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> and ſo true it is, that for the enjoyment of that, which a ſoul loves in good earneſt, ſhe makes no reckoning of fire, and flames, and a thouſand Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. So that a Soul, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, of eſpouſing one day <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> that is, the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, ſticks not to be firſt eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Lia,</hi> that is the Church ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring, with all the pains in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe God, and fourteen years, are unto her
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50147:56"/> but as an houre, ſuch is the exceſs of her love to heaven. O with what a good heart, do I drink up my tears ſaid the royal Prophet, <note place="margin">Pſ. 41.</note> when I remember I ſhall paſs into the heavenly Tabernacle! were I to make my paſſage thither, through Hell it ſelfe, how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would I runn that way? And to the ſame tune, cried out St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> with a maſculine voice, and a heart which was all heart. If I were to paſs through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Hells, ſo I might in the end of all meet with Paradiſe, and my God, how pleaſing would theſe Hells ſeem unto me? And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are infinite ſoules, would be ready to ſigne it with their heart blood, that they would be willing to dwell in the flames of Purgatory, till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon condition, to be ſure of eternal Glory; at the laſt; for believe it, they that know well the meaning of theſe four words, God Eternity, Glory, and Security, can not but have a moderate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion

                  <p>Another heavenly comfort, <note place="margin">They are impeccable.</note> which rejoyces theſe happy ſouls, in the midſt of their torments, is an infallible and certain aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which they have, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their pains be never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, yet ſhall they never offend God, neither mortally, nor venially; nor ſhew the leaſt ſign of impatience, or indignation. A true lover of God, underſtands this language, and if he do not, ſhall in a moment learn it in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and find by experience, that a ſoul there, had rather be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the deepeſt pit of Hell, then be guilty of the leaſt voluntary miſdemeanour. So that ſeeing her ſelfe to be grown impeccable, and that no evils, can have the power, to make her offend God, and that all impatience dies at the gates of Purgatory, from whence all ſins, and humane fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are quite baniſhed, O God, what a ſolid comfort muſt this

                  <p> But there is yet ſomething of a <note place="margin">To be where God has placed them</note> higher nature to be ſaid upon this point. We have all the reaſon in the world, to believe that God of his infinite Goodneſſe, inſpires theſe holy ſoules with a thouſand heavenly lights, and ſuch raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts, that they cannot but take themſelves to be extream happy; ſo happy, that St. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Genua</hi> profeſſed, ſhe had learnt of Almighty God, that, excepting onely the bleſſed Saints in heaven, there were no joys comparable to thoſe of the Souls in Purgatory. For (ſaid ſhe) when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they are in the hands of God, in a place, deputed for them by his holy Providence, and juſt where God would have them, it is not to be expreſſed, what a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they finde in ſo amorous a thought, and certainly, they had infinitely rather be in Purgatory to comply with his Divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then be in Paradiſe, with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his Juſtice, and a manifeſt breach of the ordinary laws of the

                  <p>Did we truly know what is the <note place="margin">Love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inteseſt.</note> pure love of God, a love without intereſt, and a heart that neither has, nor will have any other ends, feelings or deſigns, but thoſe of Almighty God, happily we might be able to conceive, a good part of the paradiſe of the ſouls in Purgatory. Thoſe good ſouls, ſee ſo clearly, how much it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50147:63"/> them, to have no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, or intereſt, but for Gods cauſe, that without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their own ſufferings, they had infinitely rather dwell in Purgatory, (ſince God will have it ſo) then be ſurrounded with the ſweets of Paradiſe, without Gods pleaſure; nay more though they had not the leaſt blemiſh, to wipe out, and the only queſtion were, to comply with Gods bleſſed will, who for ſome reaſon beſt known to himſelf, were pleaſed to treate them in this rude faſhion. This pure love without all ſelf intereſt, is more forcible, then any other conſideration. For if St. <hi>Paul</hi> could wiſh himſelf in hell, if <hi>Moſes</hi> could have been content, to be blotted out of the book of life, if others have offered themſelves to remaine in Purgatory til doomeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to have the aſſurance of their own ſalvation, or to ſuffer for the good of others, and all this, either out of a kind of ſelf love, or an exceſſe of fraternall charity, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50147:64"/> while they were yet intangled with the apprehenſions of this wicked world, what may not a ſoul do, which is full of divine love, without any mixture of ſelf intereſt, ſo purely refined, as not to deſire any thing but God, and the execution of his inſcrutable deſignes. And ſince all holy ſouls are of this temper, in the other world, I am confident, there is not any one ſoul, would quit Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, where God has placed her, nor any that would not moſt willingly exchange Heaven for purgatory, ſhould ſhe diſcover the leaſt inclination of Gods will, that it ſhould be ſo. The Saints are much perfecter then mortal men, who notwithſtanding all the weakneſs of fraile nature, could have the heart to caſt themſelves into burning flames, when they ſaw it made for Gods greater glory, and could there ſing out his praiſes. So happy did they take themſelves to have the power of ſerving God, without
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50147:64"/> any other intereſt, then that of his glory, nay with the ruine of their very lives, and all other worldly concerns. And when they had done all this, they would break out into tears, as the moſt eloquent, though ſilent expreſſion of a favour, they never took themſelves to deſerve. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince all the ſouls in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, have not only a perfect, but alſo an experimental knowledge; of this pure love, and withall ſee ſuch a world of devout ſouls, who are ſtill pouring themſelves out into ſuch heroicall acts, of pure love, how much think you does this encourage them to do their beſt in this kind. And can you think after all this; that God will ſuffer himſelf to be overcome in curteſy, or charity, and not be ſtill furniſhing them, with a freſh ſupply of new lights, and celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comforts? And certainly, the <note place="margin">Heavenly raptures.</note> attractions of Almighty God, are not to be numbred amongſt his leaſt favours, they do ſo tranſport

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50147:65"/> and the like, and yet for all this, could not be drawn out of their ſweet quiet, and repoſe, to give the leaſt attention, to theſe rough entertainments. What ſhall we ſay now, of thoſe faire ſouls, lately flown out of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who are ſo forcibly carried away with the pure love of God, and his eternal glory; who ſee themſelves ſo near it, and ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to enjoy it, and to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the immenſe Ocean of the Divinity. So my ſon may be one day Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> (ſaid the ambitious <hi>Agrippian)</hi> I ſhall moſt readily yeeld, to be ſoon after thrown headlong into the bottomleſs ſea. And do you thinke thoſe ſouls, who are moſt certain to raign for ever, in the Empireall heaven, can complain of the fire, wherewith they are tormented for a few hours, or years, which are but ſo many moments compar'd with eternity. St. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Genua</hi> aſſures us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God does ſo violently, and

                  <p>This pure love, which the ſouls <note place="margin">Conformity with Gods will.</note> have for Almighty God, goes not without a perfect conformity to his divine will: And this is the thing, which of all others me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſes Purgatory into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.

If God, for ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſon, would have a ſoul to be a million of years in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without fault, and without hope of any further merit, ſhe would not much concern her ſelf, neither for the extremity of the pains, nor for the length of the delay, but would reſt ſatisfied,

                  <p>Can there be any doubt of this, when we find ſouls even in this miſerable life, ſo couragious, and ſo conformable to the divine pleaſure, as to offer themſelves, to be buried in Hell fire, ſo it might but add one ſingle graine of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to Gods glory.

So well were they pleaſed, that God was ſo

Alas, would they ſay, were this to laſt to the worlds end how happy were we, and how welcome were our flames, by the light whereof, one might clearly read the fidelity of our hearts, and their conformity to the heart of the great God of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This exceſſive conformity, and <note place="margin">To coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> ſidelity of theſe holy ſouls, makes them willing, to cooperate with the ſweet rigours of Gods juſtice againſt their crimes. Who loves God purely for himſelf, loves all that belongs to make up his glory, and ſince God ſhews himſelf as much God, in the excerciſe of his juſtice, as in the ſweet influences of his boundles mercy, a happy ſoul cannot chuſe but take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to cooperate with Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50147:67"/> in procuring his ſatisfaction, even at the charge of her own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and would moſt readily annihilate her ſelf, for the honour of her God.

And holy <hi>Job,</hi> Is it not reaſon (ſaid he) that we ſhould as well receive what we call evils, at the hand of his juſtice, as favors, at the hand of his mercy? That noble Roman, that buried his Ponyard in his own Siſters breaſt, whom he met fooliſhly bewailing, the good fortune of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> had nothing to alledg for his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but this; What (ſaid he) ſhall not <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>Rome,</hi> as well in the excerciſe of rigourous juſtice, as in the maintenance of her greatneſs, and demonſtration of

                  <p>Bleſſed Father <hi>Francis Borgia,</hi> was wont to ſay, he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly go to Purgatory, and lie frying there, to the end of the world, to heap up a new treaſure of grace, and glory, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a greater Saint in heaven, and a more acceptable ſervant to his divine Majeſty. In earneſt this was an act of a noble heart, and purified ſoul, aſpiring to the higheſt pitch of perfection. The holy man took it for a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable ſatisfaction to ſee himſelf every moment, to go on encreaſing in vertue, and heaping up graces upon graces, and at the laſt, to purchaſe ſo high a place in the Kingdome of heaven, as not to have cauſe to envie the higheſt Seraphin.

For in this world, there have been Mothers have choſen rather to die themſelves then ſee their dear children die before them. There have been alſo ſouls, as I have touched elſewhere, have wiſht to be damned (alwaies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that it were without ſinn) to ſave others, and this without hope of grace, or glory, merely in obedience to perfect Charity. And why ſhould we make ſuch a wonder of it, ſince the very Tygreſs who has no heart, but what is made up of cruelty, has nevertheleſs love enough, to caſt her ſelf into flames, if ſhe find no other expedient to ſave her young ones. Can we believe, that bruits have more love, and

There was a young woman, <note place="margin">Heavenly comforts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe upon them. Val.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50147:76"/> length threw her ſelf juſt upon his heart, and ſo choſe willingly to die with him, and mingle her aſhes with his. And who doubts but the Angel Gardians, thoſe Eagles of Paradiſe, ſeeing the ſouls of their pupils, for whom they had ſo much tenderneſs, and care in this life, to lie burning in ſcorching flames, often caſts himſelf in, to comfort them, and if not releaſe them, at leaſt entertain them, with ſuch pleaſing diſcourſes as takes of much of the ſenſe of their bitter torments. When the King asked <hi>Daniel,</hi> whether the Lyond had not devoured him, and whether his God had power to preſerve him, from that inevitable death, he anſwer'd, yes ſir, my God has ſent his Angel, who is come down from Heaven, to protect me, and has tied up the mouths of the hungry Lyons, who have not offered to touch me, nor had I ever ſo much comfort, in my whole life, as in this place of death, and deſpaire, for Paradiſe is every where, where
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50147:77"/> God and his Angels are. The ſame happened to thoſe three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent yong men, who had leaſure to ſing in the middle of a burning furnace, which of a kind of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory was become a terreſtriall Paradiſe, or an empereal heaven. This being ſo, and the goodneſs of God comforting the Souls, with a world of good thoughts, you muſt know that Purgatory ſeems a great mercy to them, and ſo much the greater by how much they ſee clearly, the vaſt difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this condition of theirs, and that of the damned Souls, and what an unſpeakable favour God has done them, to diſpoſe things ſo ſweetly, that they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayed into Purgatory, they that ſo often deſerved to be thruſt into Hell fire, and poſſibly more then many of the damned ſouls, ſince there are certainly many damned but for one, or two mortal ſins, whereas they may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have committed thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50147:77"/> And who knows then, whether in their extaſies of love, they may not cry out, with holy S. <hi>Gregory.</hi> O my God, encreaſe my griefs, alas! I have deſerved far more, but with all be pleaſed I beſeech thee to remember in thy mercy, to encreaſe alſo my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and to fortify my patience.</p>

When all creatures are wanting, &amp; all other worldly ſatisfactions, eclipſed from our hearts, ſo that we remain in pure ſuffrance, and ſavour nothing but God alone, then it is, ſays the miſtical divines, that we proſeſs the joy of all joys, and the quinteſſence of all true and ſolid comfort.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50147:78"/> was S. <hi>Paul</hi> (ſays <hi>S. Chryſoſtome)</hi> when he ſpoke this? For my part, I believe, he was lying in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, in irons, neck and heels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, forſaken of all the world, and that it was in this generall dereliction, when he was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thoſe raviſhing joys of heaven, and had ſuch a feeling of Gods greatneſs, that he ſeem'd to be already ſeated at his right hand. When thinke you, ſays S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> was he rapt up into the <note place="margin">In ep. ad Cor.</note> third heaven, I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it was at his converſion, when deſpoiled of all worldly comforts, and all things failing him at once, all mighty God, ſnatcht up his ſoul into heaven, and gave him a ſweet reliſh of the delights of Paradiſe. What ſhall I ſay then of the ſouls, who ſeeing themſelves beſieged with fire and torments, and a thouſand Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms, and having no humane conſolation, are put upon a ſweet neceſſity, to have their recourſe unto God, and to ſeek their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment

Have you ever read in St <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that if a drop of the Heavenly torrent ſhould fall into Hell, Hell would no longer ſeem to be Hell, but a kind of Heaven. Now certainly the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lets fall ſome of thoſe drops into Purgatory, nor are the Angels ſparing, but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, in ſhowring them down upon the ſouls there, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few moments are to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Heaven, as high and gracious as themſelves, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly more.</p>
                  <p>I begin to fear, this diſcourſe may debauch your devotions, and coole your charity, and that, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſouls enjoy ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Purgatory, your compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them may grow ſlack, and ſo not continue equall to

Remember then, that notwithſtanding all theſe comforts here rehearſed, the poor creatures ceaſe not to be grievou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly tormented, and conſequently have extream need of all your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable aſſiſtance, pain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. When Chriſt Jeſus was in his bitter Agony, ſweating blood and water, the ſuperiour part of his ſoul enjoyed God and his glory, and yet his body was ſo oppreſſed with ſorrow, that he was ready to dye, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be comforted by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. In like manner theſe holy ſouls, have indeed great joys, but feele with all ſuch bitter torments that they ſtand in great need of our help. So that you will much wrong them and me too, to ſtand muſing ſo long upon their joys, as not to apply your beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to afford them ſuccour.

               <p>My deſigne here is, not to treat of the love of God, but only to ſuppoſe, that the more one loves God, the more he loves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to help his neighbour, and to believe that a man loves God, without doing his uttermoſt to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his neighboure, in way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is to fool him ſelf directly. Would you know how much you love God, look with what courage you uſe to ſerve your neighbour, for otherwiſe your charity is not fire, but ſmoke, and your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not divine love, but winde, or a meer natural love, or in a word ſelfe love, or rather an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhadow, or Phantaſtical appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of divine love.

This certainly was but a poor and weak diſcourſe, to give it no ſeverer a cenſure, and the conſequence of it was this, that the good man, did not only himſelf forbear to help theſe poor ſouls, but which was worſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded others from doing it, and under colour of a greater charity, withdrew that ſuccour, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe good people would have liberally afforded them. But God took their cauſe in hand, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ſouls to appear, and ſhew themſelves in frightful ſhapes and to haunt the good man, both by night and by day, without reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, ſtill filling his fancy with dreadful imaginations, and his eyes with terrible ſpectacles, and withall letting him know who they were, and why with Gods
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50147:82"/> permiſſion, they ſo importuned him with their troubleſome viſits, you may believe, the good Father became ſo affectionately kind to the ſouls in Purgatory, beſtow'd ſo many Maſſes and Prayers upon them, preached ſo fervently in their behalf, ſtirr'd up ſo many to the ſame devotion, that it is a thing incredible to believe, and not to be expreſſed with Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Never did you ſee ſo many, and ſo clear, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing reaſons, as he alleaged, to demonſtrate, that it is the moſt eminent piece of fraternal charity in this life, to pray for the ſouls departed. Love and fear are the two moſt excellent Oratours in the world, they can teach all Rhetorick in a moment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a moſt miraculous eloquence. This good Father, who thought he ſhould have been frighted to death, was grown ſo fearful of a ſecond aſſault, that he bent his whole wit, to invent the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and convincing arguments,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50147:83"/> to ſtir up the world, both to pitty and piety, and ſo perſwade ſouls, to help ſouls, and it is incredible what good enſued thereupon.

                  <p>This I take to be the pious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid. Su. d.</hi> 48. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9</note> of the Catholick Church, as delivered by the whole ſacred Torrent of Doctors. Nor is there the leaſt reaſon, why they ſhould not do it, being not only power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but full of charity, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they remember, that the like charity was beſtowed on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, that their neceſſity is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50147:104"/> extream urgent, that they are all Members of one body, that they do not only concur to the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their dear brethren, but are themſelves to receive an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional increaſe of accidental glory, for having advanced the delivery of thoſe precious ſouls, who perhaps may be holier then ſome of their own bleſſed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Beſides, this is a charitable office, ſutes well with their happy ſtate, and there appears not the leaſt inconvenience in it in this World. And yet, if this be ſo, one would think, they might ſoon turn all the ſouls looſe, and empty Purgatory, ſo that it were impoſſible, for any ſoul to make any long ſtay there. Hold, you muſt pardon me, and not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your ſelves too much, with this vain credulity. You are to know, that the Saints, are not ſuch ſtrangers to the decrees of divine juſtice, as to beg the ſouls releaſe without puniſhment, for that were the way to deſtroy all
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50147:104"/> juſtice, no, they accommodate themſelves to the Laws of heaven, and willingly ſubmit to the moſt equitable reſolves of Gods juſtice amongſt which, it ſtands irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly decreed, that this life ſhould be the place for mercy, but that juſtice ſhould bear the ſway in Purgatory. Do not then wonder, that the Saints, do not obtain ſo extra vagant a favor, the ſouls themſelves, who are the moſt nearly concerned in their own ſufferings, would be aſhamed to demand it. Is it not reaſon, that God ſhould be God in all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and exerciſe his juſtice as well as his mercy? We muſt take heed, how we employ, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſe his clemency ſo, as to break down the Laws of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Will you then know what the Saints do?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They pray God, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire <note place="margin">The ſaints have many wayes to help them.</note> the living, to offer up their ſatisfactory works for the dead and to find out a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventious
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50147:105"/> to help them. Secondly, They labour to ſhorten their time by procuring, that the intenſion, or ſharpneſs of their pains, may ſupply for the length and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, wherein there is no wrong done to juſtice, but only an exchange made of a long pain into a ſhorter one, but more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and yet this is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favour, for you cannot imagine, what an incomparable treaſure, is one day in heaven advanced before the ordinary prefixed time.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Many Saints have left behind them, a great treaſure of ſatisfactions, above what was due for their ſins, ſo many holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent hermits, ſo many chaſt Virgins, ſo many great Saints of all orders in Gods Church, who lead ſuch auſtere lives. Now is it not very likely, that theſe good Saints, may pray God, to apply the ſuperbundance of theſe their merits and ſatisfactions, to the poor ſouls in Purgatory, and who
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50147:105"/> knows, whether the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, may not accept it for good payment. Fourthly, Why may we not piouſly imagine, that even thoſe Saints, who have no ſuch remainder of merits, pray thoſe that have it, to beſtow it as an almes to relieve the poor ſouls. Sure they are ſo courteous as not to deny any thing to one another, eſpecially in a caſe of ſo great commiſeration, and why ſhould they hoard up theſe precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which cannot availe them? or how can they beſtow them more charitably.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, What harme were it to ſay, that the Saints beſeech our bleſſed Lady, and even Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who has an infinite treaſure of ſatisfactions in ſtore, to apply ſome of their precious merits this way. I know the ſeverer divines, will not have it, that the Siants have recourſe in this, to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, who has determined, what, and how he will have this applied, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50147:106"/> ſtraine, and ſet Laws of his divine juſtice, but there be other Doctors, of a milder temper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he may be drawn ſomtimes, to wave the extremity of rigour, &amp; to diſpenſe with his own Laws, ſo that by extraordinary priviledge, we may hope for this favour of ſweet Jeſus, and his Saints. And if other Saints, have ſo much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the poor Souls, you will think it but reaſonable, that the Fathers and Mothers (the ſame is to be ſaid of other near relations) who are in Heaven, and know, that the Souls of their dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are lockt up in that fiery furnace, will uſe all their poſſible endeavour, as far as God will give them leave, to fetch them out. But what ſhall I ſay, of thoſe ſaints who were lifted up into Heaven, before their time, by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary aſſiſtance of the living, whoſe turne now it is to be in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, is it not very credible, they will now requite their courteſie, and with uſury too.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50147:106"/> For example, there may be a ſoul in Purgatory, has helpt above a thouſand other Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But becauſe we are mere ſtrangers, to the ſtile of that court, and nothing acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the conſtitutions of that divine Monarchy, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude only thus. That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Saints can do, for the comfort of theſe languiſhing ſouls we may be ſure they do it, and do it punctually, without negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the leaſt moment, and where they cannot prevaile, without breaking the juſt decrees of their Soveraigne, there they willingly acquieſce, and with due ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, adore the divine juſtice.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50147:109"/> great a valew for them, he thought no ſet price could be equal to their worth, and that gold it ſelf was too mean a thing, to purchaſe ſuch precious labours, which he therefore choſe rather, to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way gratis, then to expoſe to an unworthy ſale, ſo that, the bare pleaſure he took, in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon his friends, was all the recompence he lookt for, for thoſe incomparable pieces. And certainly, it is a moſt noble, and truly royal thing, to give, and to give without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpoke a word, which ſhew'd a magnanimous, and true <note place="margin">Sen. l. de benef.</note> generous heart. To give, and to looſe all benefit by his gift, is no wonder, but to looſe all benefit and yet to be ſtill giving, is a divine Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and an act worthy of God indeed. Now when theſe chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſoules, can gratifie others, by giving away the charities, which
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50147:110"/> are beſtowed on them, why ſhould they not do it? To do a pleaſure for another, without incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating himſelf, is no more, then what you may expect of an Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian, or Barbarian, but to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf, to lye burning in fire, groaning under exceſſive tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all this, to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers happy, is certainly an act worthy of thoſe noble, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſouls, who are all inflamed with pure divine love. When they had a minde to flatter their <hi>Caeſars,</hi> the people would cry out, O <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> take away ſome of our years, ſhorten our lives, decimate our dayes, and give it all to prolong the life of our good Prince, let him live, at the charge of our lives we are all ready to lay them down at his feet, that he alone may live, and raign happily, in the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs of his Empire. Shall Infidels have more kindneſs for a mortal man, perhaps a wicked Tyrant, or a profane Atheiſt, then holy ſouls have, for thoſe that are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50147:110"/> about to be Canonized for Saints in the Church Triumphant? I have heard of great ſervants of God, who when they ſaw ſome famous Preacher, or Apoſtolical Perſon, draw near to his end, would expreſſe themſelves to this purpoſe, O that I were permitted to dye in his Roome, for I alas am but an unprofitable member of the Church, all my ſervices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail but little to advance Gods cauſe, whereas this worthy perſon may do a world of good, and be a comfort to infinite ſouls. What ſhould hinder a ſoul in Purgatory, from having the like feelings, may ſhe not, and with truth cry out, I am well acquainted with my own abilities, and can have a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer gueſſe, what I am able to doe in Paradiſe, where I am like to be one of the meaneſt ſervants in the whole houſe of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be well ſpared, but there is ſuch a ſoul, had ſhe but once cleard the petty debts, ſhe ſtands yet engaged for, ſhe would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50147:111"/> mount above all the Quires of Angels, and poſſibly ſoare up to the higheſt Seraphims. O that I might but have leave, to ſuffer here a while in her place, how willingly would I do it, that ſo my God might be the ſooner, and better glorified in heaven, by this happy ſoul, and a million of other ſouls upon earth, receive comfort, and protection, from her powerfull interceſſions. I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſign up unto her all the right I have, of being ſet free my ſelf, and if God permit, I am ready to make her a deed of gift, of all the ſuffrages, which my dear friends have ſent me, for ſure all the pains which ſhall fall upon me by this bargain, can not but be amour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſweet, ſince they are the cauſe of ſo great a good, in the empirial Court of Heaven. St. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> was already lodged in Heaven, ſays <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">l. de gemitu, col. c. de Purg.</note> when ſhe quit the glory of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, to exchange it for the flames of a thouſand and a thouſand

VVhether God accept of theſe holy deſires or no, may be a queſtion, but at leaſt, it ſeems very credible, that the ſouls who are ſo repleniſht with perfect charity, make ſuch tenders of their ſervice, as farr as God gives them leave, and as farr as it may ſtand with the laws of the Church patient. But enough of what paſſes in the other world, of which we have no certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, nor other clear light to guide us by.

Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction implies a good work, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſome grief, or pain, anſwerable to the pleaſure, we unadviſedly took in ſinning, whereby we make an honourable amends, and ſatisfie the Laws of Juſtice, by repairing the injury we have done. Impetration is a kind of letter of requeſt, which we preſent to the mercy of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to pardon thoſe, for whom we offer up the ſacrifice of our devotions, and the incenſe of our ſighs and prayers, ſo that our prayers, addreſſe themſelves to the ſole mercy of God, and crave an

Suffrage is a tearm which comprehends both, whether it be a penal work, or a prayer only, or both luckily united together. The Church triumphant, to ſpeak properly, cannot ſatisfie, becauſe there is no place, for penal works in the court of Heaven, whence all grief, and pain are eternally baniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Saints, may well proceed by way of impetation and prayers, or at moſt, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their former ſatisfactions, which are carefully laid up in the treaſury of the Church, in lieu of thoſe which are due from others, but as for any new ſatisfaction, or payment, derived from any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act of their own, it is not to be lookt for, in thoſe happy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of eternal glory.</p>

To which purpoſe, by ſpecial favour almighty God has ſomtimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſouls, to ſhew themſelves viſibly to their friends, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and to beg relief by Maſſes, Prayers, and other good works, whereby to ſhorten and diminiſh the ſharpneſs of their torments. So did <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the third, and a thouſand others, as appears by unqueſtionable relations of grave Authors. What they cannot of themſelves, they beg of us, and beg it as an alms for charities ſake and it were both ſin and ſhame to deny them. That which often

So that we may reſt confident, that whoſoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to provide for thoſe diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſouls, ſo he be qualified with the conditions which are requiſite on his part, ſhall infallibly relieve them.

This is to be wiſe indeed, theſe are matters of ſtate, which all the world would be well verſed in, as importing them far more, then the government of whole Kingdomes. Methinks, you that read this, ſhould now long to ſpread abroad this moſt excellent devotion, by erecting one of theſe ſodalities, which would be of ſo great advantage to your ſelf and others. Moſt part of mankind is ſo taken up, with building rich houſes, or providing ſtately Tombs for their Rotten Carcaſſes, they have no leaſure to

If you have no body in your thoughts, for whom you offer up your prayers, they are only beneficial to your ſelf, and what would be thus loſt, for want of application, God lays up in the Treaſury of the Church, as being a kind of ſpiritual waife, or ſtray, to which no body can lay any juſt claime.

For did not I know; that in the grand buſineſs of ſaving my ſoul, I was to have truſted none but my ſelf? did I not know, that with the ſight of their friends, at their departure, men uſe to looſe all the memory, and friendſhip they had for them? Did I not know, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had foretold us, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ready way, to build our ſelves eternal tabernacles, in the next world, is not to give all to our Children, but to be liberal to the poor? Did I not often hear it preached to me, that a cup of cold water, ſometimes luckily beſtowed, was ſufficient to put out
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50147:140"/> Purgatory fire? Did they not as often ring it in my eares, that a wiſe man ſends his good workes before him, and leaves them not for others to finiſh, as fooles do, who by that means, come to carry nothing with them but a ſhameful remorſe, which lies like an aſpe, at their breaſt, continually knawing, and devouring them. I cannot deny then, but the ſault lyes at my dore, and that I am deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus neglected by my children. And were I diſpoſed to wiſh harm to any body, I would wiſh them no greater miſchief, then that their children ſhould ſerve them, juſt as they have ſerved me; I ſay, that the ungodly wretches may come hither, and be as much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and forgotten as I am, and ſee when it is too late, what it is to truſt to the kindneſs of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is commonly buried in the ſame grave with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. It is one of my greateſt miſeries, that I have not the face, to beg any comfort of God in my

The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort I have left me in all my afflictions, is that others will learn at my coſt this clear maxim, not to leave to others a matter of ſo near concerne, as the eaſe, and repoſe of their own ſouls, but to provide for them carefully them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

All muſt not look for the ſame priviledge, which the good thief had at the laſt gaſpe. It was but little that he ſayd, but he ſpoke it with ſo cordial an accent, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to heare thoſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words, of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> and ſoon found them verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a preſent fruition of the beatifical viſion. Almighty God is pleaſed ſometimes, to make ſo forceable an entry into the heart of man, and to ſet it ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately on fire, with his divine love, that there is no remedy, but to dye between the armes of love, and griefe, and thrice happy are thoſe ſouls that looſe their lives
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50147:164"/> in this divine encounter, and dye in the amourous flames of ardent charity, they are ſure never to feel the murthering flames of Purgatory. Such was the death of our bleſſed Lady, St. <hi>John E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt,</hi> and infinite others, who have been ſtraight carried into heaven out of this world, upon the wings of love, or contrition, ſo that a heart, that is well ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with contrition, or ſteeped in a bath of ſalt tears, is like the heart of Prince <hi>Germanicus,</hi> which <note place="margin">Tacit.

                  <p>This is that they call a good <hi>Peccavi,</hi> but it muſt be a good one indeed, for it is not every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and triviall kind of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which can work ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Thoſe that have been long uſed, to actuate themſelves in thoſe generous acts of contrition, may be full of confidence, that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50147:165"/> the mercy of God, will not faile them at the houre of their death, and that their good Angels will be then ready, when it moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, to inſpire them with all the beſt motives of true contrition ſince they have gone all along with them, ſtill furniſhing them with ſuch good thoughts, and with ſo much good ſucceſs, that their hearts have been a thouſand times broken with a lively, amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and cordial contrition, and repentance for their ſins.

                  <p>A Third meanes to redeem Purgatory, is to be a zealous, and apoſtolical Preacher, for as this is a life of eminent perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and incredible merit, ſo is it extream painful, and may well paſſe for a Purgatory in this life. But obſerve, that I ſpeak of an Apoſtolical Preacher, or of one that is full of divine fire, or a holy zeal for the good of ſouls. I mean not thoſe that preach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thoſe that deſire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and adored for Oracles, thoſe that profane the word of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50147:169"/> God with their vain gloſſes, idle applications and affected elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſeeking nothing more then worldly applauſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſtroying by their life and converſation, all they build up in the pulpit. St. <hi>Paul</hi> compares ſuch vaine Preachers, to crackt trumpets, and broken bells, which make a noiſe indeed, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeleſs. They ſend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to heaven (ſayd St. <hi>Xave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius)</hi> and go Gods knows whether themſelves. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> likens them to the water of baptiſme which entitles children to the kingdom of heaven, and is it ſelf conveyed into ſome noyſome ſinke: and there turnes to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. I ſpeak then of a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who is a man of God, one that does what he ſays, and ſays what he does; one that ayms at nothing, but the ſalvation of ſouls, preaches to a few, or to many, in Cities or Villages, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts, or poor Hoſpitals, with the ſame fervour of ſpirit.

Such a one in my opinion, if he die in the exerciſe of his holy function, either goes not at all to Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſtays not there.

Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

But you long now, to have me paint you out ſuch a Preacher, for though there may be many, that ſooth themſelves up, with a vain perſwaſion, that they are the men, yet if we ſift a little narrowly into them, we ſhall poſſibly find ſo much vanity, ſo much care of eſteem, ſo many by ends, and ſo many other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections to ſteale into their ſermons, that we may ſafely ſay
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50147:171"/> there are but very few Apoſtolical preachers indeed, and ſuch as ſeek only Gods cauſe, and the good of ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Take an exact Idea from one <note place="margin">The Idea of an Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preacher</note> that lived but in the laſt Age. Father <hi>Gonzales Silveria,</hi> of the Society of Jeſus, ſcarce ever went up into the pulpit without a hairſhirt, and would ſay, a man muſt be well armed who goes to fight againſt vice. It was alſo very uſuall with him, to encounter <hi>Goliah</hi> with <hi>Davids</hi> ſling, to make a bloody diſcipline, and ſo to mount up into the Pulpit, and there like thunder, to carry all before him. He had for the moſt part, but five books for his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, to wit, his breviary the Bible, the lives of Saints, a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, and the picture of our Bleſſed Lady. In theſe five books, he ſtudied for all his ſermons, and certainly, the thunder bolt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50147:171"/> love, the ſweet flowers of his Rhetorick, were ſteeped in the milke of the Virgin, his trops and figures, and the whole variety of his ſermons, were borrowed out of the word of God, and the admirable lives of his Saints; and laſtly the religious, and devout performance of his dayly task of divine office, and holy Maſſe, gave fire to his diſcourſes, wherewith he did not only heat, but inflame the hearts of his auditours. He would preach you twice or thrice a day, and would do it the more willingly, in the meaneſt places, &amp; to the pooreſt people. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lodging was the Hoſpital, where he contented himſelf with a ſpare diet, and groſs fare, he was never obſerved, to be over nice, and coy of his ſermons, nor required he much time, to make them with applauſe. The only thing he had before his eyes, was the glory of God, and helpe of ſouls, and his life preached more then his tongue, for he really
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50147:172"/> acted more in his own perſon then he taught others: As for his manner of preaching, it was rather powerful then charming, and fitter to break their hearts then pleaſe their eares. Such was his fervour, that he poured his whole heart, and his whole zeal out of his mouth, and he would be ſo tranſported with this zeal, as not to take notice of any thing elſe. Once as he was Preaching, he ſtruck his hand upon a ſharpe naile, which ſtuck out in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and made it bleed ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, that the whole Auditory took notice of it, and ſome of the devout women courteouſly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their handkerchiefs, to bind up the wound, and ſtop the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all this while, the good man neither ſaw handkerchief, nor naile, nor blood, nor took the leaſt notice of any thing till after his ſermon, when the wound being grown cold, he was heard to wonder, how the blood came there, and to complain,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50147:172"/> that his hand put him to ſome paine. Another time, preaching in the Queen of <hi>Portugals</hi> chappel, he had put himſelf into ſuch a heat, that his mouth being clammed up, he could ſcarce get out his words, when the Queen perceiving it, called for an Ewer of water, which was inſtantly brought, and preſented him by the young Princeſſe, but the man of God, was ſo rapt in his devout thoughts, that he ſaw neither the Ewer, nor the Princeſſe, nor the Queen; ſo that they were forced to pull him by the ſleeve, that the Princeſſe Royal might not ſtand thus waiting on him, with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in her hand; and then the Queen her ſelf prayed him to make uſe of the water, to coole and refreſh his dry mouth. With much a do, the good Father came to himſelf, and riſing up, made a low obeyſance to the Queen, and to the Princeſſe, thanked them for their care, excuſed himſelf for being ſo uncivill, as not to minde

Take now the proofs of this Aſſertion, and the whole ſtrength of my diſcourſe.</p>

Take a ſecond reaſon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who exhorts us above all things to have charity for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe <hi>charity covereth the multitude of ſins.</hi> For ſince it is the greateſt Charity in the world to <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</note> help poore ſouls out of Purgatory, as I proved at large in the third Survey; thoſe that devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to this Service, may be confident ſo to cover their ſins as to put them out of the reach of Purgatory fire. When <hi>Gibellin</hi> had ſtraightly beſieged <hi>Guelph</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavary,</hi> and forced him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render his Town, upon ſuch hard <note place="margin">

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:50147:184"/> backs; but as for the men, they were to remain at mercy, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the fury of the fire and ſword: The good women laying their heads together; found out this ſtrange expedient, to ſave their husbands, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for every one taking her husband upon her back, and what elſe ſhe was able to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, they marched out of the town. Never was man ſo ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, as <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellin</hi> was at this fight, and though he might have diſputed their paſſage, as not conſiſting with the true meaning of the Articles, yet was he ſo taken with ſo rare aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme, and ſtrange example of a true conjugal love, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them all to paſs freely to the admiration of the whole world. And ſurely we may hence conclude, that all thoſe who have ſo much love for the poor ſouls in Purgatory, as to carry them, as it were, upon their backs out of their miſerable thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50147:184"/> will find heaven gates open, and all the bleſſed ſpirits ready to receive them with acclamations of joy, for ſo ſweet an exceſs of charity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is not poſſible, that they who have been thus ranſomed out of Purgatory, by the ardent zeal of their friends here, ſhould not hold themſelves obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to return I ſay the like charity to the ſouls of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours, when they leave the world. How can thoſe happy ſouls, that ſwim in the ocean of overflowing charity, chuſe but employ all their power, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to make them ſo. But ſure I need not go about to multiply reaſons, in a caſe ſo clear of it ſelf ſo full of piety, and heavenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. I will only minde you of what I told you elſewhere out of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> how reaſonable a thing it is, that all thoſe holy ſtrayes, or wandring ſuffrages, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up for ſuch ſouls as are not in Purgatory, ſhould be applied
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50147:185"/> unto them; that had a particular affection and devotion to help ſouls out of that fiery dungeon, and this certainly will be a means to fetch them out quickly, if they ever come there.</p>

How! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Count, that's not ſo, I have yet ſomething left, God be thanked, and enough too to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon the good Gentleman, for I am willing to part with thee, and to yeild up unto him all the intereſt I have in thee. Take him friend, continued he, and be ſure you do not part with him, till he has beſtowed both your daughters This he ſayd, and it fell out ſo in good earneſt; for the Courtier was glad at his own charge, to provide competent portions for the two poor young women, and all France admired,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:50147:188"/> and highly extolled the Count, for his purdent carriage of the whole buſineſs. Can you find in your heart to condemn ſuch a brave Prince to Purgatory, after he has left many ſuch charitable examples behind him, one I ſay, that has given ſo much away in pious uſes, that he has no more to give, one that would willingly have ſold himſelf after all, to make an almes of the price, to our bleſſed Saviour, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe poor innocent doves.</p>

                  <p>THe twelfth, and laſt means, to prevent Purgatory, which I intend here to propoſe, is an exact, and faithful obedience, for I cannot perſwade my ſelf, a true obedient perſon, will have much cauſe to fear Purgatory.</p>

                     <hi>Elias</hi> flew up to heaven in a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chariot, how could he do it without burning? very well, for he did it to obey God.

He will, he will, and quickly too, for though it was
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50147:200"/> his diſobedience, which made him a prey to that devouring monſter of the Sea, yet he now willingly ſubmits to the decrees of heaven, and were it to do again would as willingly caſt himſelf in, to obey the will of God, and ſince it is ſo, he will infallibly recover his liberty, and not looſe the leaſt hair of his Head.</p>

                     <hi>Moſes</hi> walks in the bottom of the read ſea, while the waters ſtand like mountains on both ſides, threatning death and deſtruction, alas, it were great pitty ſo worthy a perſon ſhould be thus loſt in waves.

                     </gap>ure, then forget to obey him, and honour all thoſe, who had rather die then diſobey. It is a kind of Martyrdom (ſays St. <hi>Thomas)</hi> to dye for obedience, and without queſtion Purgatory was not made for Martyrs. It is a perfect holocauſt, to ſacrifice his life upon the Altar of obedience, and why ſhould a heart, thus burnt and conſumed in obeying, be any more expoſed to fire? St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in his funeral ſermon of <hi>Humbertus</hi> ſays, that if that holy Monke had any thing to ſuffer in Purgatory, it was for want of a little obedience, in that which concerned the care of his health and that otherwiſe, he could not but thinke, that he went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50147:201"/> into heaven. Let us heare the great St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Whoſoever <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In Pſ.</hi> 39.</note> (ſays he) does the will of God, who lived and died in obedience ſhall not die eternally, but at the houre of his death ſhall heare thoſe comfortable words, which were ſpoken to the good thief, this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe. Why ſo? Is it not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeakes it ſo roundly? But if you will have a pertinent reaſon for it, take this. <note place="margin">2 2. <hi>q.</hi> 186. <hi>a.</hi> 5.</note> The Angelical doctour, having firſt laid this ground, that all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and Heroical vertues, put a ſoul into a moſt pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate; ſays further, a man can give God nothing, that is of more valew in this miſerable life, then to conſecrate his will, and ſubmit it not only to him, but for love of him to frail creatures perhaps ignorant, haſty and collerick, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps yonger, and leſs witty then himſelf, perhaps his own Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, his own ſon, and if you will perhaps, his own ſervant. Is not
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:50147:202"/> this a ſublime kind of Matryrdom which ends not in a moment, or with one dint of a ſword, but muſt endure a thouſand ſtrokes of an indiſcrete tongue, which go more to the quick, and this all the days of his life. Now is there any reaſon, that a man that has cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly ſuffered all theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms, ſhould be martyred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in Purgatory fire?</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Abraham,</hi> out of pure obedience, would have ſacrificed his dear <hi>Iſaac,</hi> God ſeemed ſo well pleaſed, (I had almoſt ſaid obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him for it) that by way of requital, he made a ſolemn Oath, to give him his only ſon, and the land of promiſe, flowing with all manner of delights. Tell me, is not every obedient perſon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham?</hi> nay, is he not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſince it is a far harder task, for a man to ſacrifice himſelf, then to ſacrifice his ſon; to ſacrifice, I ſay, his will, the nobleſt part of man, which is born to be ſole empreſs of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:50147:202"/> and has no other life, but to rule and command as well in the great, as the leſſer world. Now let him be but another <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſure you will not think it fit to ſend him to Purgatory, who carries in his boſome the delights of Paradiſe. The <hi>Abbot Mutius,</hi> when he turned Monke, brought his only ſon with him to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, about eight years old, that he might begin betimes to learn the fear of God. The <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> of the Monaſtery, to make trial of his obedience, peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily commands him, to take the Child, and throw him into the River, for he did nothing but diſquiet the Monks. The holy man, without diſputing the caſe, animated with an angelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and a heart like that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> takes up the Child, runs away with him to the River throws him in, and returns again with dry eyes, and without any ſign of trouble, as if he were not at all concerned, for the loſs of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:50147:203"/> his own Child. And certainly, the Child had been drowned, had not certain Monkes, who could ſwim well lain ſecretly there, by the <hi>Abots</hi> appointment, who took up this little <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaved this <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and brought him back to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, where they all ſtood in admiration, of ſo perfect an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of blind obedience, and ſelf denial, in ſo natural and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an affection, as is the love of a parent to his dear Child. The ſame day, it was revealed to the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caſſ. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> Abbot, that this fact of <hi>Matius,</hi> was as pleaſing to God, as that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that he ſhould be eternally bleſſed for it. Go now and caſt this ſoul into Purgatory, who ſtuck not to caſt his only Son into the River, at the command of his ſuperiour, and when you have done, will they not ſooner think you caſt in the whole River, which was thus bleſſed by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect act of obedience, and ſo quench the flames, then ſuffer her to lye burning there. <hi>Mutius</hi> did
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:50147:203"/> but once caſt his ſon into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and how many Religious ſouls, out of the ſame ſpirit of obedience, expoſe themſelves a thouſand times, to all dangers both by Sea and Land, and after all this, muſt they needs viſit Purgatory in their way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
                  <p>It ſeems boldly ſaid of St, <hi>Auſtin,</hi>

                  <p>For when by way of applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, they were crying up her <note place="margin">

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:50147:204"/> whom do you call my Mother, whoſoever does the will of my Father, he is my Mother, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and my whole parentage. Now to our purpoſe, if an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſon have the honour, to bear this honorable title, of being the brother, and even the Mother of God, can God ſo far neglect this brother, and mother of his, as to leave them in Purgatore fire. The Abbeſs one day commanded S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Bolognia,</hi> that for the love of God, and the excerciſe of <note place="margin">

The Saint runs away inſtantly, and doubtleſs would have thrown herſelf in, had not the Religious ſtood in the way to hinder her. It is not a crime <note place="margin">1 <hi>de civ. c.</hi> 1</note> (ſays St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi> to be thus prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of our lives; and even like <hi>Samſon,</hi> to make our ſelves away, when God requires it; No, this is no crime, but a pious holocauſt, offered upon the Altar of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and will you then kill a man that is already dead, will you
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:50147:204"/> burn him in Purgatory, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſumed in the holy flames of obedience, God does not uſe to puniſh, or purge the ſame fault twice; and therefore a ſoul that has been once purged in the fire of obedience, hath no need of being purged again in the fire of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>O what a thing it is to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, cried <hi>Gerard,</hi> as he lay a dying, in St. <hi>Bernards</hi> armes, I have been carried before Gods high tribunal, and have ſeen the power of obedience, no body ſhall ever periſh that is truly obedient; but when he comes to die, ſhall mount above the quires of Angels Arch-angels, and Apoſtles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merit of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and with this he died. Muſt Angels, Arch-angels, Apoſtles, and thoſe that are in the ſame degree of perfection, be thruſt into Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory fire? Is it reaſonable, that they ſhould be confined to ſo loathſome a priſon, that made themſelves voluntary priſoners,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:50147:205"/> under the ſevere government of obedience. I am reſolved (ſaid <hi>H. David)</hi> to fear no evils, of what ragged nature ſoever they be, <note place="margin">

                  <p>An obedient man ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but victories, ſays the holy Ghoſt in the Proverbs. What victories? Such as St. <hi>Dorotheus</hi>
